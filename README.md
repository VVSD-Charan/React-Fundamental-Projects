<br><br><br>
#### Menu 

In this project, the 'set' function is employed to retrieve distinct categories from the menu, while the 'filter' function is utilized to fetch products based on those categories. Additionally, the 'useState' React hook is employed to efficiently manage data.

<br><br><br>
#### Slider

The focal aspect of this project revolves around the implementation of CSS translate and transform. The carousel's left and right clicks are expertly managed through event listeners, while the carousel index is seamlessly handled using the React state hook.

<br><br><br>
#### Random text generator

This project marks the beginning of my React learning journey, where I tackled form handling and controlled inputs. By utilizing event listeners and React state hooks, I managed to handle data changes effectively. The project's functionality involved receiving a number input from the user and displaying that many paragraphs upon submission.

<br><br><br>
#### Color Generator

This project generates colors based on the provided hash value using Values.js. React-toastify is utilized for displaying alerts. Event listeners enable the functionality of the form, while the state hook manages the data.

<br><br><br>
#### To-Do List

I utilized local storage in the To-Do list project to prevent task loss upon refreshing the web page. React state hooks were employed to manage data stored as objects, while event listeners were implemented for checkbox clicks, task deletion, and task addition.

<br><br><br>
#### Navbar

The dynamic navbar in this project utilizes the react useRef and getBoundingClientRect() function to accurately determine the height of links when the toggle button is clicked on small screens. Event listeners are implemented to handle toggle button clicks, while the react state hook manages button clicks and controls the display of links.

#### Sidebar and Modal

The "Sidebar Modal" project serves as a valuable reference for creating visually appealing sidebars and modals in larger projects. It effectively implements React context provider and global context concepts, enabling smaller and reusable code. Additionally, the project utilizes React state hooks to manage toggle button functionality and employs event listeners to handle click events.
